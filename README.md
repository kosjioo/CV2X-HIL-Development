# CV2X-HIL-Development
This HIL can conduct automated tests on TCU/T-Box
In order to conduct simulation tests on the TCU, it is necessary to set up a HIL environment to test it. Among them, CANoe conducts ETH bus simulation, CarMaker conducts scenario simulation, Skydel conducts GPS radio frequency simulation, and vTestStudio is used to write test cases at the same time; socket interaction is carried out for different operating systems such as windows and Linux to ensure the real-time performance of HIL, where VN8914 is used in real time. This HIL can conduct automated tests on TCU/T-Box
